Google Calendar Chrome Extension
================================

Easily check Google Calendar and add new events from websites you visit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Get a button on your browser toolbar that you can easily click to see upcoming events from Google Calendar, without ever leaving your page. And if you’re on sites like Facebook or Evite, you can click the button to instantly add events to your calendar. The button shows an orange plus sign whenever there are events on the page you’re viewing that can be added to your calendar.


Instructions
------------
* This extension shows whatever calendar you are logged in within Chrome. If you want to use a Google Apps calendar, you should login to that account first, then open the extension.
* To select visible calendars, set them to visible in the main calendar page. There is no separate Options page yet.


Features
--------
* Displays a preview of your calendar while you're navigating. (works on any page.)
* If you're on certain sites where it detects the presence of events, the icon changes to a green "+". Clicking that icon lets you add the event to your Google Calendar, and shows you a Map (if there's a location it could detect.)
* Supported sites include Facebook, Evite and any site that uses the hCalendar microformat or derivative microformats such as hResume.


For Webmasters
--------------
The extension detects events on any site that uses the hCalendar microformat or derivative microformats like hResume. If you’d like events on your page to be automatically accessible, make sure you are using these microformats for your event data.


Known Issues
------------
* Some date formats in hCalendar are not parsed correctly.
* Timezones are not supported in any meaningful way. Hopefully, you'd only add events that are local.
