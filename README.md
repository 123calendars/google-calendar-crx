Google Calendar Chrome Extension
================================

[Install it now from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-calendar-by-google/gmbgaklkmjakoegficnlkhebmhkjfich).

Easily check Google Calendar and add new events from websites you visit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Get a button on your browser toolbar that you can easily click to see upcoming events from Google Calendar,
without ever leaving your page. And if you’re on sites that have special events encoded,
you can click the button to instantly add events to your calendar.
The button shows an orange plus sign whenever there are events on the page you’re viewing that can be added to your calendar.


Features
--------
* Displays a preview of your calendar while you’re navigating. (works on any page.)
* If you’re on certain sites where it detects the presence of events, the icon changes to an orange “+”. Clicking that icon lets you add the event to your Google Calendar, and shows you a map (if there’s a location it could detect.)
* Any site that uses the hCalendar microformat or derivative microformats such as hResume are supported.
* This extension shows events from whatever calendars you are logged in within Chrome.
* If you want to use a Google Apps calendar, you should login to that account first, then open the extension.


How to install a pre-release version
------------------------------------
The released version will always be available from the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-calendar-by-google/gmbgaklkmjakoegficnlkhebmhkjfich).

If you’d like to check out new features before they are released to the public, you can install a pre-release version.

1. Download the [zip file](https://github.com/manastungare/google-calendar-crx/zipball/master) and unzip it.
2. In Chrome, type “chrome://extensions” in the omnibox.
3. Turn on “Developer mode” in the top right corner.
4. Click on “Load unpacked extension…” and pick the directory in which you unzipped the extension.

The extension should now appear in the list. If a button labeled “Show button” also appears in the list, then click it.


For Webmasters
--------------
* The extension detects events on any site that uses the hCalendar microformat or derivative microformats like hResume.
If you’d like events on your page to be automatically accessible, make sure you are using these microformats for your event data.
